				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Hi, my name is Phuong. I am a fairly new programmer, coder,
					 hacker, or whatever the kids like to call it these
					 days. Personally, I like the sound of developer. A while back, I was leaning towards a career as a 
					 physician assistant, but fortuitously stumbled onto programming, 
					 and I have not looked back since. I am always looking to learn new things
					 to improve my skills and knowledge. <br/>
					 <br/>
					 My learning process:<br/>
					 <br/>
					 curiosity <em>>></em> exploration <em>>> </em> tinkering <em>>> </em> roadblock <em>>> </em> 
					 cold shower <em>>></em> discovery <em>>> </em> eureka moment <em>>> </em> elation <em>>></em> &#x1F389;
				</p>
