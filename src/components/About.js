				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Hi, my name is Phuong. I am fairly new to web development. A while back, I was leaning towards a career as a 
					 physician assistant, but somehow stumbled onto programming, and I have not looked back since. I am always 
					 looking to learn new things to improve my skills and knowledge. <br/>
					 <br/>
					 My learning process:<br/>

					 curiosity <em>>></em> tinkering <em>>> </em> roadblock <em>>> </em> 
					 cold shower <em>>></em> discovery <em>>> </em> eureka moment <em>>> </em> elation <em>>></em> &#x1F389;
